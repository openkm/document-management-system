     * Swagger2 integration notes
     *
     * The reason why has been created the class rather using xml annotation into appContext.xml class is that the number
     * of properties available from there are limited and someones like licenseUrl raise and error meanwhile from class
     * it works right.
     *
     * The best starting point at -> http://cxf.apache.org/docs/swagger2feature.html
     * For looking -> https://adarshthimmappa.wordpress.com/2017/11/22/rest-api-documentation-via-swagger/
     * For looking -> http://massfords.com/Spring-Swagger-CXF/
     *
     * Explain mandatory tags ( in our case @Path was missing what caused the services where not scanned )
     * https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations-1.5.X
     *
     * Issue with multiple jars server, to solve should be used setUsePathBasedConfig but at the end has not been working
     * and decided going into single server point rather than multiple for each service class
     * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32948315/swagger-integration-for-multiple-jaxrs-servers
     *
     * Another good documentation but because we are using Apache CXF can not be applied in our case:
     * https://www.concretepage.com/spring-4/spring-rest-swagger-2-integration-with-annotation-xml-example
     * http://www.baeldung.com/swagger-2-documentation-for-spring-rest-api
